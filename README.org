  Play [[https://soundcloud.com][SoundCloud]] music in [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] via [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emms][EMMS]].

  [[http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/techno.png]]

** Prerequisites

   This mode requires [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] 24. Other required dependencies are [[http://curl.haxx.se][curl]] to
   stream tracks, [[http://ibiblio.org/mp3info][mp3info]] to tag them, and a music player that is
   supported by /EMMS/. [[http://www.musicpd.org][Music Player Daemon]] is known to work out of the
   box, [[http://www.videolan.org][VLC Media Player]] after some tweaking.

** Installation

   /soundklaus.el/ is available on [[http://melpa.milkbox.net][MELPA]].  Instructions on how to
   configure /MELPA/ can be found [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/getting-started][here]]. After configuring /MELPA/ you can
   install /soundklaus.el/ with the following command:

   =M-x package-install [RET] soundklaus [RET]=

   If you are using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] to manage your [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] packages, you can
   install and load /soundklaus.el/ with the following code:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package soundklaus
       :ensure t
       :commands
       (soundklaus-activities
        soundklaus-connect
        soundklaus-my-playlists
        soundklaus-my-tracks
        soundklaus-playlists
        soundklaus-playlists
        soundklaus-tracks))
   #+END_SRC

** Configuration

   This mode requires a working [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emms][EMMS]] setup for Emacs. The following code
   from the /EMMS/ [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/quickstart.html][Quick-Start Guide]] should work with some minor tweaks.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'emms-setup)
    (emms-standard)
    (emms-default-players)
   #+END_SRC

*** Music Player Daemon

    If you are using the [[http://www.musicpd.org][Music Player Daemon]] everything should work out of
    the box after adding the player to the list of /EMMS/ players.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'emms-player-mpd)
    (add-to-list 'emms-player-list 'emms-player-mpd)
    #+END_SRC

*** VLC Media Player

    The default configuration of the [[http://www.videolan.org][VLC Media Player]] that ships with
    /EMMS/ doesn't support HTTPS. This can be fixed by changing the
    regular expression of the player.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'emms-player-vlc)
    (define-emms-simple-player vlc '(file url)
      (concat "\\`\\(https?\\|mms\\)://\\|"
          (emms-player-simple-regexp
           "ogg" "mp3" "wav" "mpg" "mpeg" "wmv" "wma"
           "mov" "avi" "divx" "ogm" "ogv" "asf" "mkv"
           "rm" "rmvb" "mp4" "flac" "vob" "m4a" "ape"))
      "vlc" "--intf=rc")
    #+END_SRC

*** MPlayer

    [[http://www.mplayerhq.hu][MPlayer]] can't follow redirect links when playing streams. This is
    currently required by /soundklaus.el/, so /MPlayer/ is not supported
    at the moment.

** Usage

   You can search songs with =M-x soundklaus-tracks= and playlists with
   =M-x soundklaus-playlists=. Your own tracks and playlists are
   available with =M-x soundklaus-my-tracks= and =M-x
   soundklaus-my-playlists=. In the =*soundklaus*= buffer you can move to
   the next song with =C-n= or =n=, and to the previous one with =C-p= or
   =p=. Pressing =RET= plays the current song, and =a= adds the current
   song at point to the /EMMS/ playlist. All other available key bindings
   can be seen with =M-x describe-minor-mode [RET] soundklaus-mode=.

** Authentication

   Some commands like =M-x soundklaus-activities= or =M-x
   soundklaus-my-tracks= need access to your /SoundCloud/ account. Your
   web browser should open Emacs via =emacsclient= for the [[http://oauth.net/2][OAuth2]]
   callback URL =soundklaus://oauth/callback=.

   On a Linux system you can configure this by running =M-x
   soundklaus-desktop-entry-save=. This will write the following content
   to the =~/.local/share/applications/soundklaus.desktop= file in your
   home directory.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=SoundKlaus
    Exec=emacsclient %u
    Icon=emacs-icon
    Type=Application
    Terminal=false
    MimeType=x-scheme-handler/soundklaus;
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   To setup this functionality on other operating systems take a look at
   the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#sec-3][system setup]] section in [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html][org-protocol.el]] and adapt it for
   /soundklaus.el/.

   In detail what should be done is this:

-  Make sure emacs runs as a server or as a deamon (because we use
   emacsclient for this)
-  Run these commands (some gnome utils may be necessary for them).
   Assuming emacs is in /usr/bin/emacsclient in anycase, replace with
   whatever =$ which emacs= gives you.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       $ gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/soundklaus/command '/usr/bin/emacsclient %s' --type String
       $ gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/soundklaus/enabled --type Boolean true
   #+END_EXAMPLE

-  Use firefox for this and add a new protocol handler with
   [[this%20guide%20on%20registering%20new%20protocols][http://kb.mozillazine.org/Register\_protocol#Linux]].  Remember to
   change foo with soundklaus
-  Add this line to /usr/share/applications/defaults.list

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       x-scheme-handler/soundklaus=soundklaus.desktop
   #+END_EXAMPLE

Now you can start the [[http://oauth.net/2][OAuth2]] authentication dance with =M-x
soundklaus-connect=. You should get redirected to /SoundCloud/ and
allow /soundklaus.el/ to access your account. After pressing the
=Connect= button on the /SoundCloud/ page the browser should open
Emacs and set the =soundklaus-access-token= customization
variable. You should save and load this variable from a safe place for
future sessions.
